DEFINITION Utf8Strings;

(* 
This module implements set of procedures for manipulating UTF-8 encoded strings. 
It mostly follows the Oakwood Strings module interface, but omits the Cap
function as capitalization rules are locale-dependent for UTF-8 strings. 
*)

PROCEDURE Length(s: ARRAY OF CHAR): INTEGER;

(* Copies src into dest. Truncates if dest is too small. *)
PROCEDURE Copy(src: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Inserts substr into src at codepoint position pos, writes result to dest. *)
PROCEDURE Insert(src: ARRAY OF CHAR; pos: INTEGER; substr: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Appends substr to src, writes result to dest *)
PROCEDURE Append(src, substr: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Deletes count codepoints from src at codepoint position pos, writes result to dest *)
PROCEDURE Delete(src: ARRAY OF CHAR; pos, count: INTEGER; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Extracts count codepoints from src at codepoint position pos, writes result to dest *)
PROCEDURE Extract(src: ARRAY OF CHAR; pos, count: INTEGER; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

(* Returns the codepoint position of the first occurrence of pattern in s at or after startPos, or -1 if not found *)
PROCEDURE Pos(pattern, s: ARRAY OF CHAR; startPos: INTEGER): INTEGER;

(* Replaces the substring at codepoint position pos in dest with source. *)
PROCEDURE Replace(source: ARRAY OF CHAR; pos: INTEGER; VAR dest: ARRAY OF CHAR);

END Utf8Strings.
